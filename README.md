# FlashingTotal Task

* This is an Android app that shows six numbers (fields) on screen, laid out in two columns, using MVVM and DataBinding

* Below these fields, a seventh field should show the sum of these six numbers.
* The user can tap on any of the six numbers and edit the number.
* Editing the number should cause the sum to be updated.
* Tapping on the sum should toggle flashing of this field, defined as follows: when
* flashing, the value should be shown for 500ms, then hidden for 500ms, repeated
* indefinitely; when not flashing, the value should be visible.
* Unit tests are included.
* Use Dependency Injection to create the ViewModel for the Activity.
